## Specific Disclaimer

- We only promise that the mega sdk works normally on the above platforms and environments that we have tested.
- We recommend using our recommended test environment and specific version.
- We do not promise that other test environments will work normally, and may need to be adapted by yourselves.
- If you have special needs, you can contact us for customization (sales@arducam.com).
- The mega sdk will be updated irregularly, and we will update the test status as soon as possible each time it is more detailed
